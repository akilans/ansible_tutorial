#Ansible for Beginners
	Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

Ansible Terms:

---> Playbook : It is written in YAML language where we need to write the tasks which is getting executed by ansible
	Playbooks are Ansible’s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems 		to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.

---> Inventory : It is a file has all the domain name or IP address where the playbook has to be executed by ansible

---> Module : Ansible ships with a number of modules (called the ‘module library’) that can be executed directly on remote hosts or through 		Playbooks.

Ad-Hoc commands: 

Commands runs directly on target machine
---> Run "ansible all -i hosts -u ansible -m ping" -> It checks whether the host machines are reachable or not
Response :

    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}


Playbook: 

 Check site.xml for our basic playbook without roles which installs apache2 , checkout code from github & deploy it in apache server

Roles :  Better way to organize playbook.Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.
